Part 3: Query your Filled DB
Figure out the appropriate SQL commands to find out the following, and keep track of them in the file called sql_commands.txt

All columns for all players from the New York Knicks (NYK):

	SELECT * FROM players WHERE team = 'NYK';


All columns for all players from the Indiana Packers (IND) who are under 26 years old:

	SELECT * FROM players WHERE team = 'IND' AND age < 26;


All columns for all players, ordered from least points scored to most points scored:

	SELECT * FROM players ORDER BY points DESC;



Further (use some SQL functions in queries):

All columns for all players on the New York Knicks who scored over 1000 points:

	SELECT * FROM players WHERE team = 'NYK' AND points > 1000;


All columns for all players on the Chicago Bulls (CHI) who scored under 300 points:

	SELECT * FROM players WHERE team = 'CHI' AND points < 300;


Select team column only for players that scored 2 or less points in a game:

	SELECT team FROM players WHERE points <= 2;


The average age for all players https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_count_avg_sum.asp:

	SELECT AVG(age) FROM players;

Write the node.js client.query code that executes each SQL statement from part 3 and console.logs the results.
